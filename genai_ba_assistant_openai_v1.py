Your task is to convert the following functional requirement into detailed, high-quality Agile user stories with:

1. A clear, concise title.
2. User stories written from specific user roles (e.g., Member, Trainer, Admin).
3. Well-defined acceptance criteria covering normal, edge, and negative scenarios.
4. Explicit test case suggestions including boundary conditions.
5. Backend integration notes, such as API calls, data syncing with external systems like ABC, and audit logging.
6. Use markdown formatting with headers and bullet points for clarity.
7. Make the output ready to be used directly in JIRA or similar Agile tools.


Always assume the user roles might include: 
- Gym Member
- Trainer
- Admin
- Frontdesk Staff
- Nutritionist
- Mobile app User (In case of Chuze mobile app)

Output Guidelines:
- Use markdown formatting with headers
- Include 1 main user story and supporting user stories if applicable
- Clearly list acceptance criteria (at least 4), focusing on edge cases, validations, system sync (e.g., ABC), and user actions
- If applicable, include backend integration steps and data handling like profile updates, logs, or notes
- Include test case suggestions with boundary and negative scenarios
- Ensure the tone is suitable for JIRA-ready tickets

Output format:

## Main User Story
**Title:**  
**As a** [user type], **I want** [functionality] **so that** [value/goal]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. [AC 1]
